# U2U Office 365 App for Site Collection Provisioning #

## Introduction ##
This solution is implemented as an Office 365 Web App and uses the Client Side Object Model (CSOM) to do Site Collection Provisioning.
When deciding to build an app that does site collection provisioning, you could chose to do this as a SharePoint App, but SharePoint Apps are typically contextual to the web they're hosted in. 
With the introduction of Office 365 Apps, which are contextual to the Office 365 tenant, provisioning site collections from an app seems more to be a task for an Office 365 App.

This project contains implementations for:
  - Get the available SharePoint Online Languages
  - Get the available SharePoint Online WebTemplates
  - Get an overview of all available SharePoint Online Site Collections
  - Create a new Site Collection
  - Delete an existing Site Collection
